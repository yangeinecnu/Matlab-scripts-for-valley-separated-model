# Matlab-scripts-for-valley-separated-model
VSM_boundary_plus.m is designed to supplementing boundary surrounding the margin of reversed DEM. VSM_valley_bottom.m is designed to generate valley bottom from DEM and convex region.
Above two Matlab scripts are combined with ArcGIS to process DEM data for drainage network extraction.
